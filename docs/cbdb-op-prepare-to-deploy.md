# Prepare to Deploy on Physical Machine

Before deploying Cloudberry Database on physical machines, you need to do some preparations. Read this document and [Software and Hardware Configuration Requirements](/docs/cbdb-op-software-hardware.md) before you start to deploy Cloudberry Database.

## Plan the deployment architecture

Plan your deployment architecture based on the [Cloudberry Database Architecture](/docs/cbdb-architecture.md) and [Software and Hardware Configuration Requirements](/docs/cbdb-op-software-hardware.md), and determine the number of servers needed. Ensure that all servers are within a single security group and have mutual trust configured.

The deployment plan for the example of this document includes 1 coordinator + 1 standby + 3 segments (primary + mirror), totaling 5 servers.

## Modify server settings

Log into each host as the `root` user, and modify the settings of each node server in the order of the following sections.

### Change hostname

Use the `hostnamectl set-hostname` command to modify the hostname of each server respectively, following these naming conventions:

- Only include letters, numbers, and the hyphen `-`. Note: The underscore `_` is not a valid character.
- Case-insensitive, but it is recommended to use all lowercase letters. Using uppercase letters for the hostname might cause Kerberos authentication to fail.
- Each hostname must be globally unique across all hosts.

Example:

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname cbdb-coordinator
hostnamectl set-hostname cbdb-standbycoordinator
hostnamectl set-hostname cbdb-datanode01
hostnamectl set-hostname cbdb-datanode02
hostnamectl set-hostname cbdb-datanode03
```

### Add `gpadmin` admin user

Follow the example below to create a user group and username `gpadmin`. Set the user group and username identifier to `520`. Create and specify the `gpadmin` home directory `/home/gpadmin`.

```bash
groupadd -g 520 gpadmin  # Adds user group gpadmin.
useradd -g 520 -u 520 -m -d /home/gpadmin/ -s /bin/bash gpadmin  # Adds username gpadmin and creates the home directory of gpadmin.
passwd gpadmin  # Sets a password for gpadmin; after executing, follow the prompts to input the password.
```

### Disable SELinux and firewall software

Run `systemctl status firewalld` to view the firewall status. If the firewall is on, you need to turn it off by setting the `SELINUX` parameter to `disabled` in the `/etc/selinux/config` file.

```bash
SELINUX=disabled
```

You can also disable the firewall using the following commands:

```bash
systemctl stop firewalld.service
systemctl disable firewalld.service
```

### Modify network mapping

Check the `/etc/hosts` file to make sure that it contains mappings of all host aliases to their network IP addresses. Examples are as follows:

```
192.168.1.101  cbdb-coordinator
192.168.1.102  cbdb-standbycoordinator
192.168.1.103  cbdb-datanode01
192.168.1.104  cbdb-datanode02
192.168.1.105  cbdb-datanode03
```

### Set system parameters

Add relevant system parameters in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file, and run the `sysctl -p` command to make the configuration file effective.

When setting the configuration parameters, you can take the following example as a reference and set them according to your needs. Details of some of these parameters and recommended settings are provided below.

```conf
# kernel.shmall = _PHYS_PAGES / 2
kernel.shmall = 197951838
# kernel.shmmax = kernel.shmall * PAGE_SIZE
kernel.shmmax = 810810728448
kernel.shmmni = 4096
vm.overcommit_memory = 2
vm.overcommit_ratio = 95
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 10000 65535
kernel.sem = 250 2048000 200 8192
kernel.sysrq = 1
kernel.core_uses_pid = 1
kernel.msgmnb = 65536
kernel.msgmax = 65536
kernel.msgmni = 2048
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 4096
net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 41943040
net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 31457280
net.ipv4.ipfrag_time = 60
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 10000
net.core.rmem_max = 2097152
net.core.wmem_max = 2097152
vm.swappiness = 10
vm.zone_reclaim_mode = 0
vm.dirty_expire_centisecs = 500
vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 100
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 0
vm.dirty_ratio = 0
vm.dirty_background_bytes = 1610612736
vm.dirty_bytes = 4294967296
```

#### Shared memory

In the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file, `kernel.shmall` represents the total amount of available shared memory, in pages. `kernel.shmmax` represents the maximum size of a single shared memory segment, in bytes.

You can define these 2 values ​​using the operating system's `_PHYS_PAGES` and `PAGE_SIZE` parameters:

```conf
kernel.shmall = ( _PHYS_PAGES / 2) 
kernel.shmmax = ( _PHYS_PAGES / 2) * PAGE_SIZE
```

To get the values ​​of these 2 operating system parameters, you can use `getconf`, for example:

```bash
$ echo $(expr $(getconf _PHYS_PAGES) / 2) 
$ echo $(expr $(getconf _PHYS_PAGES) / 2 \* $(getconf PAGE_SIZE))
```

#### Segment memory

In the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file,

- `vm.overcommit_memory` is a Linux kernel parameter that indicates the amount of memory that the system can allocate to a process. Setting `vm.overcommit_memory` to `2` means that when the system allocates more than 2 GB of memory, the operation will be rejected.
- `vm.overcommit_ratio` is a kernel parameter and is the percentage of RAM occupied by the application process. The default value on CentOS is `50`. `vm.overcommit_ratio` is calculated as follows:

    ```
    vm.overcommit_ratio = (RAM - 0.026 * gp_vmem) / RAM
    ```

    The calculation method of `gp_vmem` is as follows:

    ```
    # If the system memory is less than 256 GB, use the following formula to calculate:
    gp_vmem = ((SWAP + RAM) – (7.5GB + 0.05 * RAM)) / 1.7

    # If the system memory is greater than or equal to 256 GB, use the following formula to calculate:
    gp_vmem = ((SWAP + RAM) – (7.5GB + 0.05 * RAM)) / 1.17

    # In the above formulas, SWAP is the swap space on the host, in GB.
    # RAM is the size of the memory installed on the host, in GB.
    ```

#### Port

In the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file, `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range` is used to specify the port range. To avoid port conflicts between Cloudberry Database and other applications, you need to specify the port range via operating system parameters. When you later set Cloudberry Database initialization parameters, avoid setting Cloudberry Database related ports in this range.

For example, for `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 10000 65535`, you need to avoid setting the Cloudberry Database related ports in the interval `[10000,65535]`. You can set them to `6000` and `7000`:

```
PORT_BASE = 6000 
MIRROR_PORT_BASE = 7000
```

#### IP segmentation

When the Cloudberry Database uses the UDP protocol for internal connection, the network card controls the fragmentation and reassembly of IP packets. If the size of a UDP message is larger than the maximum size of network transmission unit (MTU), the IP layer fragments the message.

- `net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh`: When the total size of IP fragments exceeds this threshold, the kernel will attempt to reorganize IP fragments. If the fragments exceed this threshold but all fragments have not arrived within the specified time, the kernel will not reorganize the fragments. This threshold is typically used to control whether larger shards are reorganized. The default value is `4194304` bytes (4 MB).
- `net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh`: Indicates that when the total size of IP fragments is below this threshold, the kernel will wait as long as possible for more fragments to arrive, to allow for larger reorganizations. This threshold is used to minimize unfinished reorganization operations and improve system performance. The default value is `3145728` bytes (3 MB).
- `net.ipv4.ipfrag_time` is a kernel parameter that controls the IP fragment reassembly timeout. The default value is `30`.

It is recommended to set the above parameters to the following values: 

```conf
net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 41943040 
net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 31457280 
net.ipv4.ipfrag_time = 60 
```

#### System memory

- If the server memory exceeds 64 GB, it is recommended to set the following parameters in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file:

    ```conf
    vm.dirty_background_ratio = 0
    vm.dirty_ratio = 0
    vm.dirty_background_bytes = 1610612736 # 1.5GB
    vm.dirty_bytes = 4294967296 # 4GB
    ```

- If the server memory is less than 64 GB, do not set `vm.dirty_background_bytes` and `vm.dirty_bytes`. It is recommended to set the following parameters in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file:

    ```conf
    vm.dirty_background_ratio = 3 
    vm.dirty_ratio = 10
    ```

- To deal with emergencies when the system encounters memory pressure, it is recommended to add the `vm.min_free_kbytes` parameter in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file to specify the amount of available memory reserved by the system. It is recommended to set `vm.min_free_kbytes` to 3% of the system's physical memory. The command is as follows:

    ```bash
    awk 'BEGIN {OFMT = "%.0f";} /MemTotal/ {print "vm.min_free_kbytes =", $2 * .03;}' /proc/meminfo >> /etc/sysctl.conf
    ```

    It is not recommended that the setting of `vm.min_free_kbytes` exceed 5% of the system's physical memory.

#### Resource limit

Edit the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file and add the following content, which limits the usage of software and hardware resources.

```
*soft nofile 524288
*hard nofile 524288
*soft nproc 131072
*hard nproc 131072
```

#### CORE DUMP

1. Add the following parameter to the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file:

    ```conf
    kernel.core_pattern=/var/core/core.%h.%t
    ```

2. Run the following command to make the configuration effective:

    ```bash
    sysctl -p
    ```

3. Add the following parameter to `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

    ```
    * soft core unlimited
    ```

#### Set mount options for the XFS file system

XFS is the file system for the data directory of Cloudberry Database. XFS has the following mount options:

```
rw,nodev,noatime,inode64
```

You can set up XFS file mounting in the `/etc/fstab` file. See the following commands. You need to choose the file path according to the actual situation:

```bash
mkdir -p /data0/
mkfs.xfs -f /dev/vdc
echo "/dev/vdc /data0 xfs rw,nodev,noatime,nobarrier,inode64 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mount /data0
chown -R gpadmin:gpadmin /data0/
```

Run the following command to check whether the mounting is successful:

```bash
df -h
```

#### Blockdev value

The blockdev value for each disk file should be `16384`. To verify the blockdev value of a disk device, use the following command:

```bash
sudo /sbin/blockdev --getra <devname>
```

For example, to verify the blockdev value of the example server disk:

```bash
sudo /sbin/blockdev --getra /dev/vdc
```

To modify the blockdev value of a device file, use the following command:

```bash
sudo /sbin/blockdev --setra <bytes> <devname>
```

For example, to modify the file blockdev value of the hard disk of the example server:

```bash
sudo /sbin/blockdev --setra 16384 /dev/vdc
```

#### I/O scheduling policy settings for disks

The disk type, operating system and scheduling policies of Cloudberry Database are as follows:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th rowspan="3">Storage device type</th>
        <th rowspan="3">OS</th>
        <th rowspan="3">Recommended scheduling policy</th>
    </tr>
    <tr></tr>
    <tr></tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="3">NVMe</td>
        <td>RHEL 7</td>
        <td>none</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>RHEL 8</td>
        <td>none</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ubuntu</td>
        <td>none</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="3">SSD</td>
        <td>RHEL 7</td>
        <td>noop</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>RHEL 8</td>
        <td>none</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ubuntu</td>
        <td>none</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="3">Other</td>
        <td>RHEL 7</td>
        <td>deadline</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>RHEL 8</td>
        <td>mq-deadline</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ubuntu</td>
        <td>mq-deadline</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Refer to the following command to modify the scheduling policy. Note that this command is only a temporary modification, and the modification becomes invalid after the server is restarted.

```bash
echo schedulername > /sys/block/<devname>/queue/scheduler
```

For example, temporarily modify the disk I/O scheduling policy of the example server:

```bash
echo deadline > /sys/block/vdc/queue/scheduler
```

To permanently modify the scheduling policy, use the system utility `grubby`. After using `grubby`, the modification takes effect immediately after you restart the server. The sample command is as follows:

```bash
grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="elevator=deadline"
```

To view the kernel parameter settings, use the following command:

```bash
grubby --info=ALL
```

#### Disable Transparent Huge Pages (THP)

You need to disable Transparent Huge Pages (THP), because it reduces database performance. The command is as follows:

```bash
grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="transparent_hugepage=never"
```

Check the status of THP:

```bash
cat /sys/kernel/mm/*transparent_hugepage/enabled
```

#### Disable IPC object deletion

Disable IPC object deletion by setting the value of `RemoveIPC` to `no`. You can set this parameter in the `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` file of Cloudberry Database.

```
RemoveIPC=no
```

After disabling it, run the following command to restart the server to make the disabling setting effective:

```bash
service systemd-logind restart
```

#### SSH connection threshold

To set the SSH connection threshold, you need to modify the `MaxStartups` and `MaxSessions` parameters in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` configuration file. Both of the following writing methods are acceptable.

```
MaxStartups 200
MaxSessions 200
```

```
MaxStartups 10:30:200
MaxSessions 200
```

Run the following command to restart the server to make the setting take effect:

```bash
service sshd restart
```

#### Clock synchronization

Cloudberry Database requires that the clocks configured for all hosts need to be synchronized, and the clock synchronization service should be started when the host starts. You can choose one of the following synchronization methods:

- Use the coordinator node's time as the source, and other hosts synchronize the clock of the coordinator node host.
- Synchronize clocks using an external clock source.

The example in this document uses an external clock source for synchronization, that is, adding the following configuration to the `/etc/chrony.conf` configuration file:

```conf
# Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project.
# Please consider joining the pool (http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html).
server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
```

After setting, you can run the following command to check the clock synchronization status:

```bash
systemctl status chronyd
```
