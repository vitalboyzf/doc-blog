# Query Performance in Cloudberry Database

Cloudberry Database dynamically eliminates irrelevant partitions in a table and optimally allocates memory for different operators in a query.These enhancements scan less data for a query, accelerate query processing, and support more concurrency.

- Dynamic partition elimination

    In Cloudberry Database, values available only when a query runs are used to dynamically prune partitions, which improves query processing speed. Enable or deactivate dynamic partition elimination by setting the server configuration parameter `gp_dynamic_partition_pruning` to `ON` or `OFF`; it is `ON` by default.

- Memory optimizations

    Cloudberry Database allocates memory optimally for different operators in a query and frees and re-allocates memory during the stages of processing a query.

:::info
Cloudberry Database uses GPORCA by default. GPORCA extends the planning and optimization capabilities of the Postgres optimizer.
