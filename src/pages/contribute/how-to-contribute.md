## Benefits of Contribution

There are many reasons to contribute to Cloudberry Database and open
source projects in general. Here are some of the benefits of
participating:

* Growing your network. Working with Cloudberry Database in open
source can help connect you with people working on similar things. You
can get help or give help, and you might even make a real-life
acquaintance!

* Improving your skills. When you work on a Cloudberry Database issue
or Pull Request, inevitably you'll learn more about how something
works in our project; either by asking questions and gathering info or
by digging deeper into the code yourself. There’s a skill-building
benefit to contributing to open source projects.

* Becoming an expert. You might start new to a project like Cloudberry
Database or PostgreSQL, and by building things and opening issues when
you encounter a new challenge or a bug, you’ll learn a ton over
time. You could find your knowledge of said project has grown so much
that you’ve become an expert.

* Speaking at conferences or more community events. With those skills
you’ve earned yourself working in open source, you can let other
people hear from you, and build your professional reputation through
these community activities.

* Getting free swag! By participating in GitHub and other community
channels, you can become eligible for free swag that the Cloudberry
Database team offers as a way to say thank you.

There are undoubtedly more benefits than those listed here. Hope you
enjoy your contribution to the Cloudberry Database community!
