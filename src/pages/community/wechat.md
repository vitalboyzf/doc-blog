# WeChat Guide

WeChat, also known as Weixin in Pinyin, is a popular instant messaging and
social media application. If you prefer using WeChat over Slack for real-time
chatting or community discussions, you can add `cbdb-bot` as your WeChat
friend by scanning the QR code below and asking to join.

Once you have joined, we encourage you to introduce yourself and share what
you want to learn, so the community members can get to know you better. If you
have any questions about CloudberryDB, feel free to ask in the WeChat groups.
However, we kindly request that you search for your questions beforehand to
avoid repetition.

## Group rules

**Be kind!** We lead by our community [Code of
Conduct](https://cloudberrydb.org/community/coc), please be kind and keep
open. We want to make a friendly space for all members.

**Be patient!** We adopt the asynchronous communication way. Please be patient
to wait for other community members's replies to your questions. If no one
responds, try to ask one more time.

**Avoid global notifications.** If you're not the admin or owner, please avoid
using global notifications with @all in the group. We want to decrease noise
for community members.

**No ads, no spam.** Please don't spam others through DMs, or post something
non-related to the database. The first offense results in a warning, repeated
offenses may lead to removal.
