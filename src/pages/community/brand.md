# Brand Guidelines

Welcome to the Brand Guide for Cloudberry Database!

in reflecting the essence of our ambitious project. So, get ready to
dive deep into the world of Cloudberry Database.

In some situations, people probably use "CBDB", "CloudberryDB" for
short. We don't encourage this way but recognize it can be beneficial
to communicate with others efficiently.

all times.

#### Secondary palette

The secondary palette features a diverse set of supporting colors that
helps provide additional balance and range. Secondary colors should be
used sparingly throughout the system in order to maintain optimal
effect and a consistent look and feel.

## Typography

### Primary typeface: Noto Sans 

Noto Sans is an unmodulated (“sans serif”) design for texts in the
Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek scripts, which is also suitable as the
complementary choice for other script-specific Noto Sans fonts. It has
italic styles, multiple weights and widths, and 3,741 glyphs. Noto
Sans is licensed under the Open Font License which allows us to use it
in products & projects - print or digital, commercial or otherwise.

Noto Sans should be the primary font choice for all Cloudberry
Database materials.
