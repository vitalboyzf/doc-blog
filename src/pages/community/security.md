# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

To report a security issue, please email
[security@cloudberrydb.org](mailto:security@cloudberrydb.org). This
project follows a 90-day disclosure timeline. We will publish the
[security
advisories](https://github.com/cloudberrydb/cloudberrydb/security/advisories)
via GitHub.

You should receive a response within 2 weeks. If for some reason you
do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original
message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you
can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the
possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site
  scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the
  issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or
  direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the
  issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Do not

For better collaboration, we hope you:

- Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities.
- Do not report non-security-impacting bugs through this channel. If
  you have any questions on using, development, please use [GitHub
  Issues, Discussions or
  Slack](https://github.com/cloudberrydb/cloudberrydb/issues/new/choose)
  instead.

## Handling Process

Here's an overview of the security issues handling process:

* The reporter reports the security issues to the Cloudberry Database
  team.
* The Cloudberry Database team investigates the report and decides to
  accept or reject the report. If our team rejects the report, the
  team will explain why to the reporter. If we accept the report, our
  team will work privately with the reporter to fix the security
  issues.
* Release the new version of the Cloudberry Database that includes the
  fix.
* Public the security issues.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
